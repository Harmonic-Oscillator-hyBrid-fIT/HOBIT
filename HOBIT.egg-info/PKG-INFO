        # HOBIT: Harmonic Oscillator hyBrid fIT
        ## Efficient fit of sine(cosine) functions using a hybrid method
        
        HOBIT is a Python library that combines the power of Hyperopt (https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) with the flexibility of Sklearn oriented 
        to the teaching of physics that is able to fit in a very efficient way functions with the shape
        
        ```
        f(x) = y_0 + y_1 * Sin(omega * x + phi)
        f(x) = y_0 + y_1 * Cos(omega * x + phi)
        ```
        
        whose are commonly used to describe harmonic oscillators.
        
        ## Install
        Install HOBIT-0.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl that you can find in dist folder using 
        ```
        pip install HOBIT-0.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        ### Requirements
        Hobit will install/update the next python libraries
        
        * pandas>=1.1.3
        * numpy>=1.19.2
        * hyperopt>=0.2.7
        * sklearn>=0.23.2
        
        ## Get started
        In the folder notebooks you will find four jupyther notebooks with the following examples:
        
        1. Fit of a Cosine function using scipy and description of the gradient descent methond.
        2. Fit of a Cosine function using Hyperopt package.
        3. Fit of a Cosine function using HOBIT package.
        4. Fit of a Cosine function using HOBIT package.
        
        Detailed explanation on the usage of these codes are inside the notebooks.
